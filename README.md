# Hangman: Animals Game

This project is based on the classic Hangman game in which a user has to guess the letters in an unknown word before the game ends.
Each player has a fixed amount of lives and if the word is not guessed before the number of lives reaches zero, the player gets hanged.

This version uses only animals and gives the user a total of 6 lives to guess the correct animal.

The game was designed using only the Python language, hence it is not accessible in a web browser, but rather in the command line interface (CLI).
